# CCMACLRL_PROJECT_COM222
This repository contains the implementation of a machine learning project for COM222 class. The project aims to develop a model that accurately predicts outcomes based on input data.

## Project Overview
This study presents a Decision Tree Regression (DTR) model developed to predict rice and corn yields in Nueva Ecija, Philippines, using key environmental variables such as temperature, rainfall, and humidity. The model demonstrates strong predictive accuracy, achieving a final R-squared value of 89.87% after hyperparameter tuning, effectively capturing yield patterns based on climatic factors.

To facilitate user interaction, a web application was created using Anvil for model deployment. This application provides farmers and agricultural stakeholders with yield predictions based on specific environmental data. The model achieved a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 7.36% for rice yields and 16.56% for corn, offering actionable insights for crop planning and resource allocation.

Recommendations for enhancing the model include expanding the dataset, incorporating additional environmental variables, and exploring ensemble methods. By empowering users with accurate and accessible forecasting capabilities, this study contributes to more informed agricultural decision-making, addressing food security and economic stability in Nueva Ecija and potentially beyond.
